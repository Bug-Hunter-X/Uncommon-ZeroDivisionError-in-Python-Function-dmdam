This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python where a ZeroDivisionError is not always raised when dividing by zero. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` returns 0 if the first argument `a` is 0, avoiding the exception in some cases. This behavior is subtle and could lead to unexpected results in production code.  The solution addresses this by explicitly checking for a zero divisor and handling it appropriately.
